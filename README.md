# 2048 6D
Derivative of Gabriele Cirulli's [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), strongly based on Huon Wilson's [2048 4D](http://huonw.github.io/2048-4D/).

Because 3D to 5D versions have already been made, but not 6D as of this writing (at least a Google search doesn't return anything). [Play it here!](http://t0mdab0mb.github.io/2048-6D/)

I decided 3D wasn't enough after that...
